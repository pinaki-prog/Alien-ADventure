Using Python's Pygame I created a game.

Game concept:
A game where you play as an alien airman cruising in your own UFO.
You must be wondering what your mission would be. Right?
Your mission is to hit a specific quota to dodge punishment from Intergalactic Federation.

The reason why I made THIS
1. It's cool.
2. To let my creativity run wild.
3. To experiment with my knowledge.
4. Most importantly TO FLEX MY CODING MUSCLES.
